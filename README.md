1. How do I approach designing software?
I approach desigining software buy identifying the purpose and breaking the project down into smaller components. This helps me to visualize how each part works in the overall system. Working on my 3D scene project strengthened my ability to plan spatial layouts and object interactions, as well as how to effectively use lighting and materials to enhance the scene. I followed an iterative design process starting with a basic version of the scene and progressively adding to it by adding textures, light sources, and object refinements. The tactics I developed are strategies I can apply to future work in both software design and user interface development, where clarity, planning, and adaptability are crucial.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
I approach programming by focusing on building a solid foundation and testing often. I like to start with a basic structure, then build on it gradually, testing each piece as I go. During the development of my 3D scene, I adopted new strategies such as creating helper functions to manage repetitive tasks like setting shader uniforms or applying transformations. I also made better use of abstraction to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability. Iteration was a critical part of my process.  Every new element required visual testing and revisions to meet design goals. For example, adjusting light positioning or material reflectivity often revealed unexpected effects, which I corrected through small iterative changes. Over the course of the project milestones, my coding style changed from a quick-fix mindset to a more thoughtful, design-aware approach that emphasizes reusability and clarity.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science equips me with the skills to solve problems creatively and build solutions. Computational graphics and visualizations introduced me to a different side of programming where math, design, and logic converge. Through this course, I gained a deeper understanding of how 3D objects are rendered, how light interacts with surfaces, and how to manipulate cameras and transformations to create immersive environments. These skills enhance my educational pathway by preparing me for future coursework in graphics, game development, or user interface design. Professionally, this experience expands my capabilities in areas such as simulation design, and front-end engineering fields where visual thinking and technical execution go hand in hand. Ultimately, computer science offers me a way to build a career grounded in creativity, logic, and continuous growth.
